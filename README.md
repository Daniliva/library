# library

This program simulates the operation of the library.
There are four possible user states:
1) not registered (can view books)
2) the reader (can reserve books, view and modify the account, must confirm his email)
3) a librarian (the same as the reader, can give out books and confirm their task, send
a request to confirm email)
4) director (may change the role from reader to director).
After registration, a confirmation email is sent.

You can view a list of books by genre, author and name,as well as by genre and author 
at the same time.
There is also the opportunity to view a list of the most popular and most unclaimed 
books by genre, author and name, as well as by genre and author at the same time.
